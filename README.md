# agent-protocol-security
In recent years, AI agents have witnessed remarkable progress and are increasingly recognized as a pivotal force in various fields. Regarding agent protocols, they play a crucial role in enabling seamless communication between agents, external tools, and data sources. However, with the development of AI agents and their protocols, security has become a pressing concern.
This repository is used for code collection of IETF Hackathon. In this hackathon we aim to validate the security design (e.g. identity, authentication, authiorization) for agent protocols, including agent-to-other protocols (e.g. MCP), or agent-to-agent protocols (e.g. A2A).
